# Description
This script is designed to send random messages to a specified phone number via iMessage using AppleScript and cron jobs on a macOS system. This script simulates frequent texting to calculate typing speed based on double text message speeds. Inspired by Andy Kong's tweet on measuring friends' typing speeds through their texting habits.
